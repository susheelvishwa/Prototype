    <p>Task : Imagine you are developing a simulation game that involves various kinds of vehicles. Using the concepts
        of
        inheritance, prototype chains, and object-oriented design patterns learned in class.
        Instructions:
        <br>
        br
        Create a basic Vehicle constructor function that initializes properties like brand, model, speed, and fuelType.

        Using the prototype, add common methods to the Vehicle object like accelerate(), brake(), and refuel().

        accelerate() should increase the speed of the vehicle.
        brake() should decrease the speed.
        refuel() should log a message indicating the vehicle is refueling.
        Now, create a Car constructor function. The Car function should inherit properties and methods from the Vehicle
        object.
        Additionally, Car should have an extra property numberOfWheels and a method honk() that logs a honking sound.

        Similarly, create an Airplane constructor function that inherits from Vehicle. It should have properties
        numberOfEngines
        and hasLandingGear and a method takeOff() that logs a message indicating the airplane is taking off.

        Show how you would create a new instance of Car and Airplane, and demonstrate invoking their methods, ensuring
        that both
        types of vehicles can still accelerate, brake, and refuel through their prototype chain.
